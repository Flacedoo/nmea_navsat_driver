nmea_navsat_driver testing
===============

This directory contains GNSS log files, each containing 120 messages of each kind.
Via the playback option of the serial driver these files can be used for testing.
This doesn't cover the whole nmea_navsat_driver, but at least large parts of it.
An example test implementation is given by test_driver.py.
